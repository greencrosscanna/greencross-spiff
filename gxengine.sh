# ─── gxengine — deploy this app's Apps Script engine, and RECORD what was deployed ───────────────
# Source of truth: greencross-gx-theme/gxengine.sh. Synced into spokes by gx-sync.sh.
#
#   ./gxengine.sh                 show what would ship, change nothing
#   ./gxengine.sh --deploy        push, redeploy the EXISTING id, record the sha
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Deploying an engine was three commands held in someone's head: clasp push, clasp update-deployment,
# and then nothing at all recorded which commit went out. On 2026-08-22 five spokes were redeployed
# and answering "what is actually running" meant reading deployment descriptions and guessing which
# commit they matched -- the guess was wrong twice.
#
# The recording is INSIDE the deploy, not beside it. A separate "remember to record" step fails the
# same way the redeploy itself fails: it is the second command, and the second command is the one
# that gets skipped. That is exactly why core_pins was empty before it existed.
#
# NEVER creates a deployment. `clasp deploy` without an id mints a NEW /exec URL and orphans every
# caller -- config keys, hardcoded proxies, the lot. This only ever updates the id already serving.
