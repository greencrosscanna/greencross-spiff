#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# Deploying an engine was three commands held in someone's head: clasp push, clasp update-deployment,
# and then nothing at all recorded which commit went out. On 2026-08-22 five spokes were redeployed
# and answering "what is actually running" meant reading deployment descriptions and guessing which
# commit they matched -- the guess was wrong twice.
#
# The recording is INSIDE the deploy, not beside it. A separate "remember to record" step fails the
# same way the redeploy itself fails: it is the second command, and the second command is the one
# that gets skipped. That is exactly why core_pins was empty before it existed.
#
# NEVER creates a deployment. `clasp deploy` without an id mints a NEW /exec URL and orphans every
# caller -- config keys, hardcoded proxies, the lot. This only ever updates the id already serving.

# ── Which deployment is live? ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# @HEAD is a dev deployment and must never be the target.
#
# THIS USED TO GUESS, AND THE GUESS WAS WRONG. The old rule was "among the non-HEAD deployments take
# the highest @version". That is not what "live" means — it is just the most recently CUT deployment,
# which may be a stray nobody calls. Caught in greencross-sales on 2026-08-23: the id every caller
# uses (hardcoded as DEFAULT_PROXY in index.html) sat at @158 while an orphaned deployment sat at
# @159, so --deploy would have pushed HEAD, redeployed the STRAY, recorded a sha to core_pins, and
# printed success — while the live /exec kept serving the old library pin. A silent no-op that
# reports a deploy is worse than a failed one, and re-running does not recover it.
#
# The header above already promised "if there is more than one plausible candidate, SAY SO and stop
# rather than pick". The code did the opposite. Now it does what the comment says.
#
# THE FIX: ask who is actually called, do not rank. An id that appears BOTH in this repo's own source
# and in this project's deployment list is, by definition, the one this app talks to. That
# intersection is self-correcting — GX Core's /exec id appears in every spoke's source but is never
# in the spoke's OWN deployment list, so it drops out for free, no exclusion list to rot.
