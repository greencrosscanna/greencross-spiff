#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The GX repos live in Dropbox, so two Claude sessions on this machine open the SAME
# working tree and the SAME HEAD. Neither can see the other. `git checkout -b` is not atomic against a
# second process, and the loser finds out afterwards by reading the log.
#
# It has cost something real. 2026-09-02: two sessions shared greencross-command-center. One made a
# correct, tested fix and put it on a branch for review, because GX Core cuts are PR-gated. The other
# switched the branch out from under it — a shared checkout has one HEAD — so that commit landed on
# main, and the second session pushed and shipped it as library v284. No PR, no review, on the
# highest-stakes repo in the suite. THE CODE WAS FINE. That is the point: nothing failed and nothing
# warned. It recurred three times in greencross-spiff on 2026-09-08/09; nothing collided that time.
#
# WHAT IT ACTUALLY STOPS, and where. Three gates, because the damage arrives three different ways:
#   pre-commit             — a foreign session committing onto the branch you are holding.
#   pre-push               — a foreign session publishing it.
#   reference-transaction  — a foreign session moving HEAD or a local branch AT ALL: checkout, switch,
#                            reset, branch -f, merge, rebase. This is the one that matters most and the
#                            only one that catches the v284 shape, because the branch switch happens
#                            BEFORE any commit exists to refuse. It is also the one `--no-verify`
#                            cannot skip — that flag turns off pre-commit and pre-push and has no
#                            effect here.
# Remote-tracking refs, tags and the stash are deliberately left alone: `git fetch` hurts nobody, and a
# gate that fires on harmless things is a gate people switch off.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not stop a foreign session EDITING files — no hook exists for that, and
# ship.sh publishes the working tree, not HEAD. That half is gxtreeguard.sh's job (hub only, for now).
# The two are complementary: this one keeps the history straight, that one keeps the release honest.
#
# IDENTITY IS THE CLAUDE PROCESS, NOT THE SHELL. Every Bash tool call is a fresh shell with a fresh
# pid, so a shell pid identifies nothing. CLAUDE_PID is the one long-lived process per session, and
# `kill -0` on it is how a claim from a session that has since been closed gets cleaned up instead of
# jamming the repo forever. Subagents share their parent's CLAUDE_PID, so a subagent inherits the
# claim rather than fighting it — which is correct: it is the same session, in the same checkout.
#
# A HUMAN AT A TERMINAL IS NEVER REFUSED. With no CLAUDE_PID in the environment this is Sky, not a
# second agent, and being locked out of his own repo by a robot is not an improvement. He gets a
# one-line notice that a session holds the tree, and git does what he told it to.

# ─── ONE REPO, ONE CLAIM, ONE SET OF HOOKS — resolved against the COMMON git dir ─────────────────
# `--git-dir` is PER-WORKTREE: .git in a main checkout, .git/worktrees/<name> inside a linked
# worktree. Until 2026-09-17 both the claim file and the hook install used it, which split this gate
# two ways and made both halves lie confidently.
#
#   THE CLAIM. claim, who, release and release --force all acted on a different file depending on
#   where they ran, and none could see the other. Found live in greencross-spiff on 2026-09-16:
#   a session in a worktree held the MAIN checkout's claim, was asked to release it, ran release from
#   its worktree, removed the worktree-local file and reported "released" in good faith — while the
#   main checkout still held the claim and refused the other session's commit. Both sessions were
#   reading true answers about two different files. The dangerous direction is the other one: a
#   worktree session that arms at session start writes its claim where nobody looks, so a second
#   session in the main folder sees "free" and edits the same tree. That is exactly the
#   two-sessions-one-tree failure this script was written for after GX Core v284 shipped unreviewed.
#
#   THE HOOKS, and this half was not in the report. Git reads hooks from the COMMON dir — measured,
#   not assumed: `git rev-parse --git-path hooks` inside a worktree returns <common>/hooks, a
#   pre-commit placed there fires in the worktree, and one placed at the worktree git-dir NEVER RUNS.
#   So `install` from a worktree wrote all three gates to a path git ignores and printed success. The
#   SessionStart hook re-runs install every session precisely because this filesystem drops
#   executable bits, so in a worktree that re-arming silently armed nothing.
#
# --path-format=absolute keeps this honest regardless of cwd; --git-common-dir alone can come back
# relative. The fallback matters for an ancient git, not for ours.

# ── A CLAIM IS KEPT ALIVE BY WORKING, AND OTHERWISE EXPIRES ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# THE BUG THIS FIXES (2026-09-17). The claim was taken as a side effect of a transient act — one
# commit — and released never. Liveness was `kill -0` on CLAUDE_PID, which keeps passing for as long
# as the session is open, and FOREIGN_HOST_STALE_HOURS only sweeps claims from OTHER machines. So a
# same-host claim had no staleness at all: a session that committed once at 19:48 still owned the
# repo at 10:23 the next morning.
#
# Measured that morning: ONE hub session was holding greencross-command-center, gx-theme, sales and
# crew — four repos, up to 24 hours, all long finished. The Crew chat sat read-only for FOURTEEN
# HOURS and twice reported to Sky that Crew was locked, once inside a recommendation to defer a
# feature. A subagent inherits its parent's CLAUDE_PID so its claim outlives it, but the plain-commit
# path does the same thing, which is why "it is a subagent problem" undersells it.
#
# WHY THE FIX IS A TTL AND NOT AN IDLENESS TEST. The mismatch is the whole bug: taken by a transient
# act, released never. Renew on every gated action and expire past the TTL, and a session that is
# genuinely working keeps its claim BY WORKING while one that committed once last night drops it with
# nobody deciding anything. One rule covers the commit path and the subagent path, because both
# already route through `check`.
#
# THE COSTS ARE ASYMMETRIC AND USED TO POINT THE WRONG WAY. A false refusal is silent, permanent and
# self-confirming — the tool never once suggested the claim might be dead, so the Crew session
# believed it and repeated it as fact. A false release is loud, rare, and recoverable through the
# reflog. When the call is close, bias toward releasing. (Reasoning from the Crew session, 2026-09-17;
# the first draft of this fix tried to measure idleness, which is a harder question this need not ask.)
#
# 90 MINUTES, AND WHY THAT IS SAFE. This lock protects HISTORY — commits, pushes, branch changes —
# not the working tree, which is gxtreeguard.sh's job. A session that has not performed a gated action
# in 90 minutes is not mid-`checkout -b`. The 2026-09-02 incident that justifies the whole mechanism
# played out in MINUTES, and a live TTL still refuses that case exactly as before.
#
# RENEWED BY THE HOLDER'S OWN `who`/`status` TOO, not only by gated actions. A working session checks
# constantly — this one ran `who` dozens of times in a day — and that is good liveness. It is
# holder-only on purpose: if a FOREIGN session's `who` renewed the claim, the stuck state would
# rebuild itself, and the sessions most likely to poll `who` are the ones being refused.
#
# kill -0 IS KEPT as well. A closed session still frees its repo immediately rather than in 90
# minutes; the TTL is the backstop for a session that is alive but finished.

    # explained: one cause was found and fixed (gx-sync.sh used to chmod in a sweep at the end, so an
    # interrupted run froze mktemp's 0600 — gx-theme 647fc45), but files have been observed 755 right

    # repos. A controlled A/B would not reproduce it in either arm. That remains open; see gx-sync.sh.

    # guard in the suite already invokes these through `sh` (which reads the file and ignores the
    # mode), so the ONLY path that needs the bit is a human typing `./deploy.sh`. Repairing it
    # wherever we happen to be running is cheaper than the alternative — rewriting 153 occurrences of
    # `./deploy.sh` across eight repos' docs, most of them in per-repo CLAUDE.md files that are
    # deliberately not synced and would drift straight back.

    # The list matches gx-sync.sh's. Keep them together: a script that syncs 755 and a script that
    # repairs 755 disagreeing about WHICH files is how one of them silently stops covering something.
