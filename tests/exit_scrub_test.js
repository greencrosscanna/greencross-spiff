/* ─── every way an engine SAYS something must scrub credentials on the way out ────────────────────
 *   RUN:  node tests/exit_scrub_test.js          (synced from greencross-gx-theme/gx-exit-scrub-test.js)
 *
 * WHY THIS IS SHARED AND NOT PER-APP. On 2026-09-17 four apps were audited by hand, one session each,
 * and every one of them had an exit nobody had counted:
 *
 *   crew        7 MailApp.sendEmail sites, exactly ONE scrubbed — the unfiled-bug notice, the send
 *               somebody had actually looked at. Plus two Script Properties holding an un-scrubbed
 *               stringified result, one of which a health check folds into a reason that a weekly
 *               recap renders into an email.
 *   sales       1 mail site, 0 scrubbed, carrying GX Core's error text verbatim.
 *   spiff       1 mail site, 0 scrubbed, plus a stored error field with no reader TODAY.
 *   pricecards  3 mail sites; the two digest sends carry no error text at all, so their lack of a
 *               scrub is correct rather than missed — and the third rendered the browser's page
 *               address and captured JS errors raw while scrubbing the server's own line.
 *
 * NONE OF THAT WAS A MISSING SCRUB FUNCTION. Crew HAD a correct, derived, tested scrub and still had
 * six unscrubbed sends. The missing piece was never shared code — it was that a scrub at one exit
 * says nothing about a second exit. So this test does not check that a scrub EXISTS. It finds every
 * place an engine emits something and asks whether THAT ONE scrubs.
 *
 * The seventh app is the point. Each of those four was found by a person looking; whichever app
 * nobody looked at would still be leaking, and the next exit added to any of them would not be found
 * at all. A test is what makes it not depend on somebody looking.
 *
 * ── WHAT COUNTS AS AN EXIT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ContentService.createTextOutput (what a route says back) and MailApp/GmailApp.sendEmail (what it
 * mails). Those are the two that carried real credentials this week.
 *
 * NOT stored values, deliberately, and this is the known gap: crew's Script Property held an
 * un-scrubbed error for weeks with no reader, until it turned out to have one. A store is only a
 * leak when something reads it back out, and that read is usually one of the exits above — so this
 * catches the escape and not the accumulation. Scrub at the write anyway; a test cannot see it.
 *
 * ── HOW A CALL SITE PASSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * 1. The function containing it calls something named like a scrub (scrub/redact/sanitize), OR
 * 2. the call site carries an explicit marker saying why it needs none:
 *
 *        /* @gx-exit-ok: only renders queue card fields, no caught exception ever reaches this *​/
 *
 *    A marker REQUIRES a reason. "@gx-exit-ok" alone fails — a silent waiver is how the first
 *    unscrubbed send gets a second one. Price Cards' two digest sends are the case this exists for:
 *    genuinely nothing to scrub, and saying so in the source beats a test that cries wolf twice a day.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT CANNOT DO ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * It reads source text. It cannot prove the scrub is applied to the right argument, or that the
 * regex behind it is correct — crew's was anchored and missed connector_secret= for weeks while
 * passing any check of this kind. Each app still needs its own executing test for the scrub itself.
 * This one answers a different question: is there an exit nobody has looked at? That is the question
 * that had four different wrong answers this week.

/* THE EXIT IS WHERE THE PAYLOAD GOES, NOT WHERE THE ENVELOPE IS MADE.
 *
 * `ContentService.createTextOutput()` with EMPTY parentheses emits nothing — it mints an empty
 * output that something fills later with `.setContent(...)`. Sales builds most of its replies that
 * way, and the first version of this test reported all fifteen of them as unscrubbed. They are not:
 * the content goes through setReply_, which scrubs. Fifteen false positives in the app that had just
 * shipped a real fix is precisely how a test gets switched off, so the pattern has to follow the
 * data rather than the constructor. */
/* DO NOT REQUIRE `ContentService` ON THE SAME LINE. The first version matched
 * /ContentService\s*\.\s*createTextOutput\s*\(/ and greencross-leaderboard wraps it:
 *
 *     return ContentService
 *       .createTextOutput(callback + '(' + json + ')')
 *
 * so its ONLY reply builder was never counted, and the test reported "0 unaccounted" for replies
 * while never having looked at one. Caught by the leaderboard session, which did not trust the pass
 * and went looking by hand — and found two unscrubbed reply exits returning a GX Core exception that
 * carries the deploy secret in its URL.
 *
 * That is the same failure as the anchored-scrub regex this file's header already describes, and the
 * same as the green gates the hub's CLAUDE.md warns about: a pattern that quietly excludes the
 * commonest case, reporting success while testing nothing. Twice in one file is the argument for
 * running a new test against every real engine and then disbelieving the passes. */

 * this test while it was unscrubbed. The second was found by writing a fixture for the first rather
 * than taking the fix on trust — nobody had named it, and it would have gone on passing.
