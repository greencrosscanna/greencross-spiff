# ─── SHARED SessionStart hook (source of truth) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Surface pending brain-notes addressed to THIS app from GX Core's central inbox (brain_notes). Cross-app
# handoffs AND bugs — which now ride the notes rail (gxIngestBug emits a 🐞 note to the owning chat) — reach
# the acting chat here, whichever chat wrote them. Fails silent (no secret / offline).
#
# Every spoke uses THIS script; the ONLY per-repo edit is the APP= line. Copy it to
# <repo>/.claude/gx-brain-notes.sh and set APP to the app's GX key. To change the hook, edit it HERE and
# re-copy to the spokes (keep them identical apart from APP=).
#
# WHY THE RETRY: GX Core's /exec is a two-hop redirect that ~6% of the time serves a Drive HTML error page
# instead of JSON. A single fetch would silently drop the whole inbox on that miss (this is how the rec-price
# note was lost). gx_fetch RETRIES until it gets real JSON — normally one fast call; retries only fire on the flake.
