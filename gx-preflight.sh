# ─── gx-preflight — refuse to ship dev leftovers ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Source of truth: greencross-gx-theme/gx-preflight.sh. Synced into spokes by gx-sync.sh, which also
# installs it as .git/hooks/pre-push. Run it by hand any time:  ./gx-preflight.sh
#
# The local-live loop is fast because the working tree IS the app. Its one hazard is that a thing you
# flipped to iterate — fixtures on, writes armed, an A/B flag, a localhost URL — rides along to Pages
# and staff get it. This blocks the push instead of relying on you to remember.
#
# Tag any deliberately temporary block with  @devonly  and preflight will refuse to ship it:
#     if (params.get('chart') === 'cached') { ... }   // @devonly A/B — strip before shipping

# 6. REFERENCED-BUT-UNTRACKED LOCAL ASSETS. Proposed by the Leaderboard chat after my GXDev wiring
#    shipped in their v1.506: index.html carried <script src="gx-dev.js"> while gx-dev.js itself was
#    still untracked, so every kiosk load 404ed. Inert, because the call site was guarded -- but a
#    failed request on every page view, and preflight passed clean because it looked for none of this.
#    The general rule: any same-origin relative src=/href= must be a file git actually tracks.
