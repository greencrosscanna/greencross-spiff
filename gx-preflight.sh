# ─── gx-preflight — refuse to ship dev leftovers ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Source of truth: greencross-gx-theme/gx-preflight.sh. Synced into spokes by gx-sync.sh, which also
# installs it as .git/hooks/pre-push. Run it by hand any time:  ./gx-preflight.sh
#
# The local-live loop is fast because the working tree IS the app. Its one hazard is that a thing you
# flipped to iterate — fixtures on, writes armed, an A/B flag, a localhost URL — rides along to Pages
# and staff get it. This blocks the push instead of relying on you to remember.
#
# Tag any deliberately temporary block with  @devonly  and preflight will refuse to ship it:
#     if (params.get('chart') === 'cached') { ... }   // @devonly A/B — strip before shipping

# ── SELF-HEAL: sweep this repo's orphaned preflight worktrees ────────────────────────────────────
# 20 of these were found across the suite on 2026-09-09 — ~80MB, oldest 2026-08-29 — left by this
# script and theme-preflight.sh. Both create a sibling worktree to test HEAD and remove it in a trap,
# but a run killed outright (a canceled push, a closed terminal) never reaches the trap. Left alone
# they accumulate in the parent folder, sync to every machine over Dropbox, and get picked up by any
# grep across the suite — one of them polluted a dependency audit before anyone noticed.
#
# Sweeping at START rather than only trusting cleanup at END is what makes this self-correcting. It
# is why the hub's run-tests.sh has had zero .gxruntests-* orphans since it adopted the same fix on
# 2026-08-30, while these two scripts kept accumulating them for eleven days.
#
# TWO GUARDS run-tests.sh DOES NOT NEED, AND THIS SCRIPT DOES. That one is hub-only, so its blind
# `../.gxruntests-*` glob can only ever match worktrees it made itself. This script is synced into
# SEVEN repos that push concurrently:
#   • SCOPE TO THIS REPO'S PREFIX. A bare ../.gxpreflight-* glob would let a sales push delete the
#     worktree a crew push is running its tests inside — turning the self-heal into the outage.
#   • SKIP A LIVE PID. The suffix is $$. If that process still exists, a concurrent preflight in
#     THIS repo owns the worktree. A recycled pid only means a dead one survives to the next run,
#     which is the safe direction to be wrong in.

# with it) and left an instruction to restore it once exempted. Adding it here is that exemption.

# Comment-only lines are dropped unless the 4th arg is "comments" — otherwise prose ABOUT a hazard
# ("// USE_FIXTURES = true reads fixtures") trips the check, and a hook that cries wolf on a clean
# tree gets --no-verify'd within a day, which defeats the whole point. The @devonly check is the one
# that deliberately wants comments.
# -a KEEPS THE DIAGNOSTICS, and that is the whole of the claim. If a shipped file contains a NUL
# byte, grep may classify it as binary and collapse every match to the single line
# "Binary file <name> matches" — no path, no line number, no offending text.
#
# WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT DO, measured 2026-09-09 rather than reasoned, because two sessions
# (mine included) got this wrong in both directions first:
#   • It does NOT disable the gate. `hits` is still non-empty, so a hard check still sets FAIL and
#     still blocks the push. A clean file still passes. Verified with a real `@devonly` leftover in a
#     NUL-bearing file at every position tried: CAUGHT every time.
#   • It DOES destroy the report. You are told the push is blocked and given a filename with no line
#     and no matching text, on a file grep has decided it cannot quote — which on a 240KB proxy is a
#     blocked push nobody can act on.
#
# POSITION MATTERS AND NOTHING CHOOSES IT. /usr/bin/grep (BSD, what this hook gets under /bin/sh)
# classifies from the FIRST BLOCK only. Minimal pair, identical size and token, NUL position the only
# difference:  byte 1 -> "Binary file early.gs matches" · byte 312000 -> "late.gs:6002:@devonly".
# greencross-sales carried two NULs at offset 196535 (a '\0' delimiter written as a literal byte,
# commit edc075d) and its hook read the file normally — purely because they landed late.
#
# The agent-facing `grep` is a shell function wrapping ugrep, which scans the WHOLE file and behaves
# differently again. So a measurement taken at an interactive prompt does not describe this hook.
# -a removes the whole question: never classify a shipped source file as binary.

# ─── Run this repo's tests ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Everything above catches dev leftovers — things that should not SHIP. This catches things that
# should not WORK. Both belong on the push, for the same reason: a check that only runs when someone
# remembers is a check that stops running.
#
# That is not hypothetical here. On 2026-08-22 a GX Core sales-cache branch was found to have never
# executed once in its life — a TypeError swallowed by a bare catch, with a fallback producing
# identical numbers. Nothing failed, nothing logged, and it was found by accident. The suite had 152
# passing assertions at that moment and not one of them ran on a push.
#
# Convention over configuration: any tests/*_test.js in the repo, run with node. No test dir, no node,
# or no matching files -> silently fine, so this is safe in every spoke including the ones with no
# tests yet. A test that FAILS blocks the push exactly like a hard flag does.
# ── JUDGE THE COMMIT, NOT THE DESK ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These tests used to run against the working tree. A pre-push hook that does that is answering the
# wrong question: it tells you your DESK is healthy, when what is about to reach everyone else is
# HEAD. The two differ constantly here, because every repo sits dirty for long stretches.
#
# It cost something on 2026-08-29. In greencross-crew, a session staged a test file while its
# implementation was still unstaged, and a second session's `git commit` swept the shared index.
# Commit 69b4150 carried the test and not the code: checked out clean it failed two of its own
# tests, while the working tree passed all twelve. The hook would have waved it straight through.
#
# The rule already existed twenty lines up — the missing-asset check reads `git show HEAD:page`
# precisely because a half-landed change once 404ed every app with a green preflight. The test run
# just never followed it.
#
# So: if the tree is dirty, run the suites inside a throwaway worktree checked out at HEAD.
#   • A CLEAN tree needs no worktree — HEAD and the tree are the same bytes. Most pushes skip this.
#   • The worktree is a SIBLING, not /tmp. The cross-app suites reach ../greencross-<app>, and a
#     worktree under /tmp resolves that to nothing and turns a real contract test into a silent skip.
#   • If the worktree cannot be made, tests still run — against the tree — and SAY SO. Degrading
#     quietly to the weaker check is how this hole stayed open in the first place.
