# ─── gx-preflight — refuse to ship dev leftovers ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Source of truth: greencross-gx-theme/gx-preflight.sh. Synced into spokes by gx-sync.sh, which also
# installs it as .git/hooks/pre-push. Run it by hand any time:  ./gx-preflight.sh
#
# The local-live loop is fast because the working tree IS the app. Its one hazard is that a thing you
# flipped to iterate — fixtures on, writes armed, an A/B flag, a localhost URL — rides along to Pages
# and staff get it. This blocks the push instead of relying on you to remember.
#
# Tag any deliberately temporary block with  @devonly  and preflight will refuse to ship it:
#     if (params.get('chart') === 'cached') { ... }   // @devonly A/B — strip before shipping

# 6. REFERENCED-BUT-UNTRACKED LOCAL ASSETS. Proposed by the Leaderboard chat after my GXDev wiring

#    still untracked, so every kiosk load 404ed. Inert, because the call site was guarded -- but a
#    failed request on every page view, and preflight passed clean because it looked for none of this.
#    The general rule: any same-origin relative src=/href= must be a file git actually tracks.

# ─── Run this repo's tests ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Everything above catches dev leftovers — things that should not SHIP. This catches things that
# should not WORK. Both belong on the push, for the same reason: a check that only runs when someone
# remembers is a check that stops running.
#
# That is not hypothetical here. On 2026-08-22 a GX Core sales-cache branch was found to have never
# executed once in its life — a TypeError swallowed by a bare catch, with a fallback producing
# identical numbers. Nothing failed, nothing logged, and it was found by accident. The suite had 152
# passing assertions at that moment and not one of them ran on a push.
#
# Convention over configuration: any tests/*_test.js in the repo, run with node. No test dir, no node,
# or no matching files -> silently fine, so this is safe in every spoke including the ones with no
# tests yet. A test that FAILS blocks the push exactly like a hard flag does.
