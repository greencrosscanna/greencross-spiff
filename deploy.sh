# ─── SHARED deploy recorder (source of truth: gx-theme) ──────────────────────────────────────────
# Record a release in the GX Core shared version log. Synced into every spoke by gx-sync.sh, which
# fills the app-key placeholder from the repo's .gx_app. Run AFTER you ship (git push to Pages /
# clasp deploy engine). Do NOT write that placeholder literally in prose here: gx-sync substitutes
# every occurrence, so an explanatory mention becomes 'fills inventory from the repo's .gx_app'.
#   Usage:  GX_NOTES="what changed this release" ./deploy.sh
# Version comes from the ?v=NN cache-buster on the JS <script>, falling back to an APP_VERSION /
# GC.VERSION constant for monolith apps that have no external JS. To change this script, edit it
# HERE and re-sync spokes.

#  1. the ?v=NN cache-buster on a JS <script>   (crew, price-cards, spiff — apps with external JS)
#  2. an APP_VERSION / GC.VERSION constant      (inventory, sales — monoliths with inline JS)
# A monolith has no external .js file to hang a cache-buster on, so #1 alone found nothing. Under
# `set -euo pipefail` a no-match grep aborts the whole script, which is why releases for those two
# apps were never recorded at all. Both greps are `|| true` so a miss falls through to the next
# source instead of killing the run.
# MAJOR.MINOR is allowed here, and extracting it needs BOTH halves changed. The old second stage was
# `grep -oE '[0-9]+'`, which stopped at the dot and filed spiff.js?v=1.28 as "v1" — silently, with a
# success line. Widening only that class to `[0-9.]+` is worse, not better: it matches the dot in
# ".js" first and yields "." for EVERY app, including the integer ones that work today. So the second
# stage is a sed that strips up to `?v=` instead of a grep that hunts for digits anywhere in the tag.
# Verified both ways: 1.28 -> 1.28, 2.10 -> 2.10, 26 -> 26, 40 -> 40. No spoke regresses.

# ── The suite version format: vMAJOR.BBB, a 3-digit zero-padded build ──────────────────────────
# Checked HERE so you find out before you ship, not after. GX Core's gxRecordVersion enforces the
# same rule server-side — that one is the real gate (any curl can skip this script), this one is the
# one that saves you a redeploy. Keep the two in step; the rule is documented in gx_core.gs.
#
# Six repos each deciding independently what a version looks like is how this drifted: measured
# 2026-08-23 the suite held v1.583, v3.02, '2.5', v42, v1.28 and v1.28 — three build widths, one app
# with no MAJOR at all, one missing its `v`, and two apps colliding on the same number.
#
# Widths that disagree do not sort: 'v1.28' is ABOVE 'v1.280' as a string and BELOW it as a number,
# so What's New ordering and every "is this newer than what I've seen" check disagree the moment a
# counter crosses a digit boundary. A fixed width is what makes one comparison rule work everywhere.
#
# The pad is to the RIGHT. The build is the fractional half of a decimal that has been counting up,
# so v1.28 is the 280s — left-padding to v1.028 would send the app backwards past everything it has
# already shipped.
